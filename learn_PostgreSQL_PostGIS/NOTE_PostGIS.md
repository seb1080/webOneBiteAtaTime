- Raster: The multiband cell type.

- Topology: The relational

### Geometry Types

| Type                 | Description               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `POINT`              | Single point              |
| `LINESTRING`         | Connected line segments   |
| `POLYGON`            | Area enclosed by line     |
| `MULTIPOINT`         | Collection of points      |
| `MULTILINESTRING`    | Collection of lines       |
| `MULTIPOLYGON`       | Collection of polygons    |
| `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` | Mixed geometry collection |

### Spatial Reference System

A Spatial Reference System defines how the position of points on the Earth's surface is represented in space â€” through coordinates that are tied to a specific mathematical model of the Earth.

ðŸ‘‰ It consists of:

a Datum â†’ defines the size and shape of the Earth (ellipsoid) and how that ellipsoid is aligned to the real Earth (geoid);

a Coordinate system â†’ defines how coordinates (latitude, longitude, height, X/Y/Z, or projected coordinates) are expressed;

a Map projection (optional) â†’ defines how to flatten the Earth's curved surface into a 2D map.

### Spatial Indexing

Spatial Indexing is a method of organizing spatial data (points, lines, polygons) so that spatial queries can be performed very quickly.

ðŸ‘‰ Without an index, spatial queries (like ST_Intersects, ST_Within, ST_DWithin, ST_Contains, ST_Distance) would require a full table scan â†’ comparing every geometry â†’ very slow.

ðŸ‘‰ With a spatial index, the database can rapidly filter out most geometries and only test the ones that could actually match.

| Index Type                                  | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **R-tree / GIST (Generalized Search Tree)** | Most common in PostGIS â€” stores geometries in a **hierarchical bounding box tree**.                 |
| **Quad-tree**                               | Divides space into 4 quadrants recursively â€” used in some in-memory engines or vector tile systems. |
| **Grid index**                              | Divides space into fixed grids â€” sometimes used in combination with others.                         |
