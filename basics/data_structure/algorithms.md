## Recursion

In computer science, recursive function is a function that called itself.
Recursive functions solve complex problem through the "divide-and-conquer" method.

Recursion is common in a variety of data structures.

Stack overflow is when the maximum number of call stack of the program exceeded the limited amount of address space (memory).

### Base case or terminating case

Recursion there must be a base case. Because recursive method called himself they will never stop, unless this base case is reached.
